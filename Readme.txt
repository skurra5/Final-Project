# Wine Quality Analysis Project

## Overview

## Project Overview

This project examines the correlations between physicochemical
properties of wine and their impact on wine quality. Various
classification models, including Random Forest and Logistic Regression,
are evaluated for their effectiveness in predicting wine quality.
Additionally, we employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce
dimensionality, to check if it improves model accuracy and efficiency by
highlighting key features while addressing overfitting and
multicollinearity.

## Technical Specifications

-   Programming Language: Python 3.x
-   Libraries Used:
    -   pandas
    -   numpy
    -   matplotlib
    -   seaborn
    -   scikit-learn
    -   imbalanced-learn

Make sure you have the required libraries installed using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
imbalanced-learn

## Dataset

The dataset consists of two CSV files, these files are provided in this zip file.

winequality-red.csv - Contains data for red wines.
winequality-white.csv - Contains data for white wines. These files
should be placed in a directory accessible to your Python environment.

## Running the Project

-   Ensure all dependencies are installed.
-   Modify the file paths in the script to point to your dataset
    location.
